Review,Sentiment
"When you go to the 'Look inside' option, you can see that the code has colors. But the Paperback format (printed version) does not have color. I hadn't purchased the book if I had known this before. Too expensive for a black and white printed edition.",negative
"I wouldn't recommend if completely new to coding in general, however if you are confident debugging (as the errors are generally small), it is useful. Not mentioned are some of the data files which are located on the authors github account (the url links in the book don't work also)",negative
"I bought this book for a master's data science class and it is the one book I keep referring back to. If I forget how to code something or haven't done a particular task in a while, i'll just pop it open, it's easy to find the right spot because each task has its own section and the code samples are great.",positive
"Please review the table of contents before purchasing this book - Machine Learning chops until after a number of chapters. It does not look as easy as it looks - you will have to practice a ton before you can comfortably use these skills on a regular basis with a reasonable amount of precision - but I thoroughly enjoyed the gentle introduction topics. Overall a definite handbook to have in one's Data Science arsenal.",positive
"If you are following a parallel course of ML then this book is great to support you .. Large amount of practical example.",positive
"I have been studying data science during this pandemic; and since it has been a while since I graduated from college, my brain hasn't been as analytically sharp as I wanted it to be. And like many others, I've scoured the Internet to supplement what I have been studying. I've found many; but Chris's web site was the most organized and lucid to follow, with pertinent comments for practically every code. Hence each exercise is explained clearly. I realized I don't always have access to the Internet, so I decided to purchase the book. More power to Chris in helping us less mortals understand machine learning!",positive
"Chris Albon has a broad and deep knowledge of data science. This book is a treasure of hints, explanations, and examples for the use of Python and associated libraries, including Pandas, in machine learning. It is not a text, but it much more than cheat sheets. Chris begins with common operations with arrays, vectors, and matrices -- loading, sorting, examining, analyzing, combining, modifying, transforming. Then continues with procedures used to prepare data -- data handling, normalization, standardization, encoding categories, selecting date ranges, dimensionality reduction, feature selection, and cross-validation. Several chapters review models, including techniques for model selection, hyper-parameter tuning, performance metrics, and discussions of fitting and validation. Each topic is clearly explained and accompanied by a short, self-contained, listing of a Python (Version 3) program as illustration. I highly recommend this book to all of us who need a quick refresher related to a command or procedure.",positive
"This is a great resource for quick and insightful tips for your machine learning challenges. As the author states, you do need to have python and machine learning experience to get maximum benefit from this book. I would argue that even those with less Machine Learning experience can learn a lot from the first 8 chapters. Chapters 9-21 are definitely best suited for someone that does have some experience using scikit-learn. Bottom line, this is a useful resource to have next to your computer when those machine learning problems pop up in your day to day work.",positive
"The book starts by explaining each function with an example that makes sense. But it builds on these pieces as the book continues. The approach is well disciplined and pretty quickly you are building solutions. A mix of theory and code with emphasis on the latter. You won't learn calculus but you will learn how to do it from the code. Good for those who dropped out of Andrew Ng's courses and mortals wanting results. Me: 40 years development, MBA, and 5 years data science. Imagining and prediction mostly.",positive
"Perfect when you need to find out how to do something specific, like most of the Cookbooks are. This one didn't disappoint.",positive
"I loved this book for helpful code on python. It isn't too detailed because it covers a wide range of topics, however it really sets up a base to help google further. Highly recommend",positive
"This book is perfect to have on your desk to look up a quick how-to on just about any data science task. It has everything from data wrangling to advanced machine learning techniques.",positive
"The purpose of this book is not to teach you ML. As a reference however, I've found it indispensable. I currently have the Kindle edition which is great because I can just search on 'random forest' or whatever. But I intend to also purchase the paperback to keep on my desk. I also like the template the authors use: Problem, Solution, Discussion. Find the problem you want to solve, use the solution code as your template, but be sure to read and comprehend the discussion. I'm employed as a Data Scientist. I have over a dozen books on Data Science-type subjects, and the only two I reference almost daily are this one, and 'Pandas for Everyone' by Daniel Chen.",positive
"The book is meant to be introductory but dives straight into Python programming with NumPy and sklearn without showing the ropes of the libraries. The introduction to the ML concepts is gentle and well explained but the code is shoved down your throat and you better run to the docs to see what is actually does.
"Saving point is: if you are teaching ML (like me) and need good well designed examples go for this book; also if you need very visual explanations. Would not recommend the book for a student though.",negative
"Had a lot of issues trying to get the coding running. The plot_interactive_tree.py used through out the book used a imread module which no longer exists in its old place, you will get a bitter taste of the 'dependency hell' of python out from these code. For me I had to give up after a couple days of trying.",negative
"I found this book to be quite informative for someone who just get into machine learning. Lots of good examples provided ... however, I want to see some more real world application examples rather than sample data sets.",negative
"Nice Book. Exactly this is what you require to get you started on machine learning. Even after reading multiple theory books and watching Andrew's machine learning videos for nearly one year, I was not knowing how to actually put my knowledge into practice. After reading this  book only, I was able to create ML models on my own and got a bit more comfortable in ML area. Trust me you don't need a masters to read and understand this book, but a bit of python knowledge helps.",positive
"Fantastic introduction to machine learning in Python. The examples are well written, and do a very nice job of introducing both the implementation and the concept for each model. I'm halfway thru the book, and am really enjoying it. I have a background in math and wrote software professionally for a number of years, but haven't spent much time doing either for the past 5-10 years. This book is technical enough to keep me interested, and accessible enough to allow me to ramp up on the language and the scikit framework. An added bonus - the instructions actually allowed me to set up my development environment, and the code in the book actually runs! 100% recommend for someone looking to get started in ML with Python.",positive
"A great book to start and nderstand machine learning. It explains the math behind the algorithms also enough to understand the concept.",positive
"A healthy discussion of the skills and techniques you'll need to perform best-practices machine learning and data science. Very concise code examples and practical demos!",positive
"A practical and to-the-point introduction to many Machine Learning Algorithms and their applications. Andreas responds to the issues and pull requests on the book's github repo same day.",positive
"A very easy-to-read but comprehensive guide for ML, strongly recommend this to anyone who are interested in entering this field.",positive
"It's not that the concepts in the book are hard, it's that the wording & explaining of the concepts are choppy, and the examples don't translate well to Ebook format (it's actually really choppy and confusing). Also, there's not a whole lot of great examples in the code.",negative
"This book is worthless; I sent it back. You may derive some benefit if you are new to programming, but this book is full of warm milk for programming babies; it contains no strong meat, which pros require to produce commercial quality product at scale.",negative
"The topics and concepts in the book are the ones that the Pro programmer will use. However, the author did a pure job of implementing it. Unfortunately, there are too many unneeded talks and comparisons instead of getting straight to the point. In addition, the author's example is so long that you must go back and forth between chapters to see pieces of the code.",negative
"This book is full of great information but is entirely worthless for anyone actually trying to learn and not decorate a bookshelf. I write code with nano or vs code, this book forces you to use jupyter notebooks and google colab and gives no way for you to just sit down and write out your own code , I wanted actual code examples and lessons to learn to write my own code, not a premade project I boot up and just run. Do not buy if you are interested in learning.",negative
"I don't normally rate books but this one was so bad, I hope to save others from purchasing it. First off, the book seems to have been written in a single sitting with no proof-reading. There are sentences that don't make sense, either a missing hyper-link or missing image (I couldn't tell what the author was referencing) and an abundance of extraneous information that appears to be fluff designed to make the book longer. As someone who knows nothing about Python, I honestly didn't learn anything reading it.",negative
"This seems to be a good read for non programmer or someone who is just learning to code. I wouldn't recommend to any professional who already know programming at basic or intermediate level in some language. The actual syntax of the statement is one liner with little to no explanation of parameters and results. There are plenty of trivial examples and their output if you like that.",negative
"Can't see the point of buying it. It gives you NOTHING more than free tutorials on the net. And does that in a poor approach and format as well. "Introducing Python: Modern Computing in Simple Packages" is the best python book outthere and a perfect enty - in my opinion at least. But see my review there about python as such....",negative
"very disappointed with this book. i was expecting more code samples but the author was too busy with other less trivial things.",negative
"Utter waste of money. As someone that has done a fair bit of coding in the past I wanted an introductory text to Python - something that would outline what could really be done with the programming language and provide an entry point to it. What a waste. The book is elementary on the one hand - and yet manages to miss a ton of required detail to actually do anything useful. Don't waste your time with it.",negative
"You'll end up reading this book in one breath. There are no code examples to follow. It's just a very very very brief what python is, where to look for information on it, getting help, etc. There is maybe two pages that have any kind of syntax on it and its only a 'hello world'. I got a refund on the book.",negative
"As a Computer Science enthusiast, I've always wanted to learn Python but never seemed to have the time to do so. Python is growing in popularity every day becoming the main coding language for many applications today. I have to say that after reading this book, I feel ready to comfortably write basic code with Python. Like other computer languages, and languages in general, it take a while and a lot of practice to fully master. However, this book provides numerous guidelines on how to improve your Python skills as well as online resources for researching and asking questions on the topic. I highly recommend this book if you're trying to learn Python.",positive
"This book does not teach how to use the command words in Python or its syntax. It teaches readers philosophy of how the Python program is in place and how to use the philosophy for programming. At the end of the book the author gave some ideas and resources for how to use Python programing in real life. The book is succinct and well organized. I enjoyed reading it, though I did not use it as a practice book for how to program in Python. There are many how to books -- Good book to have in your bookshelf",positive
"If you already understand the world of programming this guide provides a quick overview of Python's major capabilities. Not for someone who is starting at square one on programming.",negative
